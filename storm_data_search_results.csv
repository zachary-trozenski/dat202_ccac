This rain fell onto ground that was already nearly saturated from heavy rainfall a few days earlier.  These conditions produced moderate flash flooding across the southwest corner of the state starting late on the 18th and continued into the 19th.  

However, the heaviest rainfall during this event occurred over the headwaters of the Monongahela River in northern West Virginia, where widespread rainfall exceeding 3.0 inches was recorded.  This produced major river flooding downstream along the Monongahela River towards Pittsburgh.  This rain event also produced minor flooding along the Youghiogheny River. 

The following are crests/flood stages in feet for several locations along the Monongahela River:  Point Marion  32.3 feet (crest)/26 feet (flood stage); Grays Landing 24.5/22; Maxwell 36.5/32; Charleroi 38.5/28; Elizabeth 27.6/20 and Braddock 24.2/22.  Along the Youghiogheny River, only one forecast point went over flood stage as  Connellsville crested at 12.5 feet, just above the flood stage of 12 feet.  

In response to the river flooding, the Governor of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency for four counties (Allegheny, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland) in southwest Pennsylvania.  In those four counties, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency estimated just over 600 homes were damaged by the flooding.  However, most of those homes sustained basement damage only.  The hardest-hit county was Washington, where around 400 homes sustained damage.  The city of Monongahela, also in Washington County, appeared to be the hardest-hit community, as 23 homes reported major damage and another 77 received minor damage.  In Allegheny County, the most serious damage appeared to be concentrated in Elizabeth and West Elizabeth where 31 homes had minor damage and one suffered major damage.  In Greene County, although most of the damage was limited to several flooded roads and basements, the Greene Cove Yacht Club reported damage of around $500,000.  Despite the damage sustained across the four counties, no injuries were reported.        

In Pittsburgh, the Ohio River at the Point crested at 23.7 feet, just below the flood stage of 25 feet.  This forced the closure of the Mon Parking Wharf, Point State Park, and the 10th Street Bypass.",4

Lebanon, West Mifflin, and the City of Pittsburgh along the Route 51/88 corridor.  

The town of Hays was probably the hardest hit of all the communities, with over 75 homes and 20 commercial properties reporting heavy damage.  Several cars were swept away by the floodwaters, forcing the rescue of several people who were trapped in the vehicles.  The water even swept away a pleasure boat parked in a private driveway.  Emergency officials also rescued several people trapped in their homes by the high water.  

In McKeesport, a car dealership along State Route 48 saw a 3- to 4-foot high wall of water and mud ruin 35 to 40 new cars -- an estimated $2 million dollar loss.  Several businesses in downtown McKeesport, along with City Hall, received minor water damage.  At The Marina at McKees Point, 16 boats were lost and a pier buckled.

In Sharon, Mercer County, wind gusts estimated as high as 70 MPH blew a tree down onto a garage, causing considerable damage.  Several homes in Sharon also had parts of their siding blown away.  

The highest wind in the event was an estimated 75 MPH gust in Farmington, Fayette County.  Part of a roof was blown from a barn at that location.  

In Indiana County, the high wind damaged several residential roofs and produced isolated incidents of structural damage.
